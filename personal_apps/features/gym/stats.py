"""Pure analysis for the gym tracker.

No Flask, no SQLAlchemy, no queries, no I/O. Every function takes
already-loaded data and returns plain Python, which is what makes the maths
checkable without an app context or a database (see tests/test_gym_stats.py).
If something here needs a query, it belongs in routes.py instead.

The single input shape is PerformedExercise: one exercise as it was actually
performed in one session, carrying only *completed* sets. routes.py builds
these from the ORM in one pass and everything here consumes them.
